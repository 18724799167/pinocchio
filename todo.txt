* Check commit 13f8e6f (conversion from long to double)
* Create a .cpp for non template code:
      - multibody/model.cpp
      - multibody/parser/urdf.cpp
* Re-organize the python modules, in eigenpy and pinocchio. Eigenpy should be a module (now loaded by pinocchio).
* Add boost test suite to all tests (crba, rnea etc..) 
 
Replace int type with Data::Index where it is necessary. The idea is to be able to switch between int and long according to the current architecture.

* Add computation of 3d jacobian
* Add algo to compute the velocity, acceleration of a point attached to a body
* Add computation of non linear effects
* Add global computation of M, b, and J in the same loop
* Add computation of dM/dq, db/dq, db/dqdot, etc
* Add additionnal in data structure to avoid useless computations
