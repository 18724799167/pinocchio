## Abstract

We introduce Pinocchio, an open-source software framework that implements rigid body dynamics algorithms and their
analytical derivatives. Pinocchio does not only include standard algorithms employed in robotics (e.g. forward and
inverse dynamics) but provides additional features essential for the control, the planning and the simulation of
robots. In this paper, we describe these features and detail the programming patterns and design which make Pinocchio
efficient. We also offer a short tutorial for easy handling of the framework.
