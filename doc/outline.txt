*** Overview
- ABSTRACT (taken from SII paper)
- Installation link
- Simplest example with compilation command (load urdf and run rnea)
- More complete example with C++ and Python (load model and run a loop for an IK with 3D task)
- How to cite Pinocchios
- Presentation of the content of the documentation.

*** List of features
# Take the list from SII, shorten the description and add url links to the doc.
# This should act as an index of the remaining of the doc.
- Spatial algebra
- Model and data
- Supported kinematic models
- Dealing with Lie group geometry
- Geometric models
- Main algorithms
- Analytical derivatives
- Automatic differentiation and source code generation

*** Mathematics
# For each subpart, add the list of "main related topics" toward algo description, specification, etc
# and add the direct url toward corresponding pages of the doc.
- Overview: rigid dynamics, joint dynamics, articulated dynamics, algorithms
- Rigid bodies: geomtry, kinematics and dynamics
- Joint dynamics: geometry, configuration space, kinematics, tangent space, list of joints
- Articulated dynamics: kinematic tree, configuration and velocity, geometry, kinematics and jacobian, inverse and direct dynamics
- Collision volums
- Main algorithm: list taken from SII
- Templatization, autodiff, code gen

*** Implementation
# Should we put implementation before mathematics. If not, we should make clear in the math
# section that the reader may want to jump to the implementation section and skip the math.
- Overview: what is making Pinocchio efficient
- CRTP concept
- Spatial Algebra module
- Model / Data separation
- Joint module
- Loading the model
- Algorithm module
- Templatization (concept, code gen, auto diff)
- Python bindings
- Unit test

*** Tutorials
# These should be a bunch of simple examples in Python and C++ doing key functionnalities.
# They should be chosen so that the documentation is evident.
# The code example both in C++ and Python should be in a stand-alone plain .cpp and .py file,
# possibly added in unittest/doc/*.cpp and unittest/doc/python/*.py (to be defined).
# It would then be straight forward to check at commit time that the .cpp are respecting
# the current API of Pinocchio. If adding .py test feature in our build test, extending
# to .py file test would be easy as well.
- Loading the model
- Computing the dynamics RNEA, bias forces b(q,v), gravity g(q), CRBA M(q)
- Contact dynamics
- Loading and displaying the model
- Collision detection and distances
- Derivatives of the dynamics (with finite diff checking)
- Code generation
- Inverse geometry
- Inverse kinematics (clik)
- Task space inverse dynamics
- QP (normal forces) unilateral contact dynamics (if we can write it concise enough)
- Posture generation using derivatives (if we can write it concise enough)
- A RRT planner for a robot arm (if we can write it concise enough)

*** Benchmarks
- Overview of algo with plots
- Description of how to run the benchmarks

*** Success stories
# List of projects succesfully using pinocchio
- TSID
- HPP
- DDP
- Supaero class
- WAN demonstration
- List of papers with videos based on Pinocchio

*** Modules
# Main classes and functions (functions are yet missing)
- Spatial
- Multibody
- Joint
- Parsers
- Algorithms
# We also yet have benchmarks and unittests in the list. Better put then otherwise, is it not?

*** Python "cheat sheet"
# Main functionalities and commands to be used in python.
# No clear ideas yet about how to present that info.

*** Python Sphinx documentation
# To be added once Sphinx doc of Pinocchio is mature.
# OStasse suggests a new project that allows inserting sphinx in doxygen.
# We first have to generate a stand-alone sphinx of pinocchio and double check that we are happy with it.
