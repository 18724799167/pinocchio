# Mac OS X

We support the installation of Pinocchio through the Homebrew package manager. It is sufficient to write in Terminal:

```
brew tap gepetto/homebrew-gepetto
brew install pinocchio
```

It will install all the missing dependencies together with Pinocchio.

An alternative solution is to install Pinocchio either with robotpkg (see From robotpkg section for further details) or directly from sources (see From source section).
