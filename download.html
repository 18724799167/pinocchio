<p class="lead">
The software architecture has been tested entirely on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 12.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS. If you are running other distributions, we expect the library to work correctly but we can not guarantee it. If you only want the C++ library, without python binding and 3D-vizualisation tool, do not install eigenpy nor gepetto-viewer related packages.
  </br>
  There is currently no released binary package.

  To install Pinocchio from sources, you will first need to perform installations of other packages themselves dependent on other ones. To facilitate the procedure, you will find in the tab "Source" all you need to install Pinocchio and
  Gepetto viewer (ie the 3D-vizualisation tool we advice to use in complement of Pinocchio if you need to display your robots)
